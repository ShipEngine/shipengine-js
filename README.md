> âš  **WARNING**: This is alpha software under active development. This repo is a successor to https://www.npmjs.com/package/shipengine. Until this has a stable release, we recommend you either stick to the current releases, or use the [ShipEngine API](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/) directly.



Quick Start
--------------------------
Install ShipEngine JavaScript SDK via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

```bash
npm install shipengine-js
```

The only configuration requirement is an [API key](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/#api-keys).

```javascript
const ShipEngine = require("shipengine-js");

const shipengine = new ShipEngine("___YOUR_API_KEY_HERE__");

```
Methods
-------------------------------
* [`createLabelFromRate`](./docs/create-label-from-rate.md) - When retrieving rates for shipments using the `getRates` method, the returned information contains a `rate_id` property that can be used to purchase a label without having to refill in the shipment information repeatedly.
* [`createLabel`](./docs/create-label.md) - Purchase and print a label for shipment.
* [`getRates`](./docs/get-rates.md) - Given some shipment details and rate options, this method returns a list of rate quotes.
* [`listCarrierAccounts`](./docs/list-carrier-accounts.md) - Returns a list of carrier accounts that have been connected through
the [ShipEngine dashboard](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/carriers/setup/).
* [`trackByLabelId`](./docs/track-by-label-id.md) - Track a package by its associated label ID.
* [`trackByTrackingNumber`](./docs/track-by-tracking-number.md) - Track a package by its associated trackng number.
* [`validateAddresses`](./docs/validate-addresses.md) - Indicates whether the provided addresses are valid. If the addresses are valid, the method returns a normalized version based on the standards of the country in which the address resides. If an address cannot be normalized, an error is returned.
* [`voidLabelById`](./docs/void-label-by-id.md) - Void a label by its ID.
