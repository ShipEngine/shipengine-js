Quick Start
--------------------------
Install ShipEngine JavaScript SDK via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

```bash
npm install shipengine
```

The only configuration requirement is an [API key](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/#api-keys).

```javascript
const ShipEngine = require("shipengine");

const shipengine = new ShipEngine("___YOUR_API_KEY_HERE__");

```
Methods
-------------------------------
* [`createLabelFromRate`](./docs/create-label-from-rate.md) - When retrieving rates for shipments using the `getRatesWithShipmentDetails` method, the returned information contains a `rateId` property that can be used to purchase a label without having to refill in the shipment information repeatedly.
* [`createLabelFromShipmentDetails`](./docs/create-label-from-shipment-details.md) - Purchase and print a label for shipment.
* [`getRatesWithShipmentDetails`](./docs/get-rates-with-shipment-details.md) - Given some shipment details and rate options, this method returns a list of rate quotes.
* [`listCarriers`](./docs/list-carriers.md) - Returns a list of carrier accounts that have been connected through
the [ShipEngine dashboard](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/carriers/setup/).
* [`trackUsingLabelId`](./docs/track-using-label-id.md) - Track a package by its associated label ID.
* [`trackUsingCarrierCodeAndTrackingNumber`](./docs/track-using-carrier-code-and-tracking-number.md) - Track a package for a given carrier and tracking number.
* [`validateAddresses`](./docs/validate-addresses.md) - Indicates whether the provided addresses are valid. If the addresses are valid, the method returns a normalized version based on the standards of the country in which the address resides. If an address cannot be normalized, an error is returned.
* [`voidLabelWithLabelId`](./docs/void-label-with-label-id.md) - Void a label with its Label ID.
