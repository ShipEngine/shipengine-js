> âš  **WARNING**: This is alpha software under active development. This repo is a successor to https://www.npmjs.com/package/shipengine. Until this has a stable release, we recommend you either stick to the current releases, or use the [ShipEngine API](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/) directly.



Quick Start
--------------------------
Install ShipEngine JavaScript SDK via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

```bash
npm install shipengine-js
```

The only configuration requirement is an [API key](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/#api-keys).

```javascript
const ShipEngine = require("shipengine-js");

const shipengine = new ShipEngine("___YOUR_API_KEY_HERE__");

```
Methods
-------------------------------
* [`validateAddress`](./docs/validate-address.md) - Indicates whether the provided address is valid. If the address is valid, 
  the method returns a normalized version of the address
based on the standards of the country in which the address resides.
* [`normalizeAddress`](./docs/normalize-address.md) - Returns a normalized, or standardized, version of the address. If the 
address cannot be normalized, an error is returned.
