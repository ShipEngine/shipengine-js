Track Using Carrier Code and Tracking Number
======================================
[ShipEngine](www.shipengine.com) allows you to track a package for a given carrier and tracking number. Please see [our docs](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/) to learn more about tracking shipments.

Input Parameters
-------------------------------------

The `trackUsingCarrierCodeAndTrackingNumber` method requires the carrier code and tracking number of the shipment being tracked. If you are using TypeScript, you can import the [`TrackUsingCarrierCodeAndTrackingNumberTypes.Param`](https://github.com/ShipEngine/shipengine-js/blob/main/src/track-by-carrier-code-and-tracking-number/types/public.ts)
type into your project to take advantage of your
IDE's code completion functionality.

Output
--------------------------------
The `trackUsingCarrierCodeAndTrackingNumber` method returns tracking information associated with the shipment for the carrier code and tracking number.
If you are using TypeScript, you can import the [`TrackUsingCarrierCodeAndTrackingNumberTypes.Result`](https://github.com/ShipEngine/shipengine-js/blob/main/src/validate-addresses/types/public-result.ts)
type into your project to take advantage of your IDE's code completion functionality.

Example
==============================
```javascript
const ShipEngine = require("shipengine");
const shipengine = new ShipEngine("api_key");

async function trackUsingCarrierCodeAndTrackingNumber() {
  try {
    const result = await shipengine.trackUsingCarrierCodeAndTrackingNumber({carrierCode: "stamps_com", trackingNumber: "9405511899223197428490"});

    console.log("Tracking info:");
    console.log(result);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Error tracking shipment: ", e.message);
  }
}

trackUsingCarrierCodeAndTrackingNumber();
```
